"""
Comprehensive tests for the webserv project.

This file uses a function-scoped fixture to start a fresh server instance for every test
to avoid interference between tests.

The tests cover various aspects from the project specification and the given configuration file,
including:
  - Basic GET for the root ("/index.html")
  - Redirect behavior (e.g. /oldDir/ and /imagesREDIR/)
  - Testing endpoints with different allowed methods (GET, POST, DELETE)
  - Verifying a CGI redirect
  - Checking custom error responses for non-existent resources
  - Testing for oversized client request bodies

One asynchronous test simulates multiple concurrent GET requests.

Run tests with:
    python3 -m pytest -v python_unit_tests.py
    or
    python3 -m pytest -v python_unit_tests.py::test_repeated_requests (single test)
